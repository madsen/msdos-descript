MSDOS::Descript $%v%$
Copyright 1997 Christopher J. Madsen

DESCRIPTION

    This module provides access to 4DOS style DESCRIPT.ION files.
    It can both read and write them.

REQUIREMENTS

    You must have the Tie::CPHash module (a case-insensitive hash).

    Additionally, you should have the MSDOS::Attrib module if it's
    supported on your system (it currently works on OS/2 and Win32
    systems).  If you don't have MSDOS::Attrib, then any DESCRIPT.ION
    files modified by MSDOS::Descript will no longer be hidden files.
    This means that they will show up in directory listings.

    Both these modules are available on CPAN in the "authors/id/CJM"
    directory.
