MSDOS::Descript version {{$version}}, released {{$date}}


This module provides access to 4DOS style DESCRIPT.ION files.
It can both read and write them.



INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

{{ $t->build_instructions }}



DEPENDENCIES

{{ $t->dependency_list }}

    You must have the Tie::CPHash module (a case-insensitive hash).

    Additionally, you should have the MSDOS::Attrib module if it's
    supported on your system (it currently works on OS/2 and Win32
    systems).  If you don't have MSDOS::Attrib, then any DESCRIPT.ION
    files modified by MSDOS::Descript will no longer be hidden files.
    This means that they will show up in directory listings.

    Both these modules are available on CPAN:

        http://search.cpan.org/dist/Tie-CPHash/
        http://search.cpan.org/dist/MSDOS-Attrib/
